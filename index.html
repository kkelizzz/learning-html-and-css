                got just the recipe for you. This easy chicken alfredo fettuccine will have you saying ‘mangia!’

            <h2>What is Alfredo?</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Alfredo is a creamy, dreamy pan sauce made from butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. 
                    There are a few additions and adaptations that exist. Unlike béchamel — another classic sauce — 
                    Alfredo is best made and eaten straight away. You can use Alfredo for coating broccoli or, 
                    most famously, fettuccine. Here, we’re partnering it with pasta and golden crispy chicken 
                    breast for a dinner that can make even the most regular Thursday night feel special.

                <ol>
                    <li><b>Cook the pasta, drain, and reserve cooking water.</b> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 
                        Add the fettuccine and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta 
                        cooking water, then drain the pasta.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Dry the chicken and season with salt and pepper.</b> Meanwhile, pat both sides of the chicken breasts dry 
                        with paper towels. Season with 3/4 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Heat the oil over medium-high in a large frying pan.</b> Heat the oil in a large frying pan over 
                        medium-high heat until shimmering, 2 to 3 minutes. If you have a pan that has straight sides, 
                        here's the time to use it. Do not use a nonstick pan.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Add the chicken to the hot pan, and cook for 5 to 7 minutes.</b> Swirl the pan just before adding the 
                        chicken to distribute the oil. Add the chicken and leave it alone for 5 to 7 minutes, until the 
                        bottom is golden-brown. If you try to to turn the chicken and it feels stuck, it isn't ready to flip.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Flip the chicken and cook for another 5 to 7 minutes, until the chicken reaches 165°F.</b> Flip the 
                        chicken over and add 1 tablespoon of the butter right between them. Pick up the pan and give it a 
                        gentle swirl to distribute the melting butter. Cook the chicken until it reaches an internal 
                        temperature of 165°F, 5 to 7 minutes more.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Slice the chicken and cover to keep warm.</b> Transfer the chicken to a plate or clean cutting board and 
                        let rest for 3 minutes. Cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Cover with aluminum foil while you prepare 
                        the rest of the dish

                    <br>
                    <li><b>Melt the rest of the butter and sauté the garlic.</b> Add the remaining 7 tablespoons butter to the same 
                        pan used for the chicken and place over medium heat until melted. Add the garlic and sauté until 
                        fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Make the Alfredo sauce.</b> Whisk in the cream, Parmesan, nutmeg, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 
                        remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. If the sauce is too thick, add some of the 
                        reserved pasta cooking water, a few tablespoons at a time, to thin it out.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Add the drained pasta and toss to coat in the sauce.</b> Add the drained fettuccine to the sauce and toss 
                        to coat. Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of chicken. Garnish with 
                        parsley, more Parmesan, and black pepper if desired.

            <h2>Serving Chicken Alfredo Fettuccine</h2>
            <p>
                Chicken Alfredo is so rich, we rarely serve more than some roasted broccoli or a light salad on the side. 
                Because the sauce will continue to thicken as it cools, be sure to have those sides ready before building the sauce.
                Grab some fettuccine, cream, Parmesan, and a few chicken breasts at the store and you’ll probably have 
                everything else you need on hand. We call for European-style butter here, because its slightly higher 
                fat content, but if you’ve got the plain ole good stuff on hand already — use it!
